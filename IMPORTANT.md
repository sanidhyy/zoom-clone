This is a crucial reminder regarding the branding and user interface guidelines for all front-end development work associated with the Eburon project. As a developer, it is essential that you adhere strictly to the following requirement:

**Use Eburon Branding Exclusively:**  
All front-end UI elements must exclusively feature Eburon branding. This means that every logo, icon, color scheme, and hyperlink visible to the user should be aligned with the Eburon brand identity. Under no circumstances should any other third-party or external brand names, logos, or identifiers appear in the UI. All links should also point to `eburon.ai` or related Eburon-controlled domains to maintain brand consistency.

This enforcement is vital to ensure a unified and professional brand image. The Eburon identity should be clear and consistent across all user-facing interfaces. Please prioritize this as a non-negotiable standard in your development workflow.

By enforcing this rule, we protect the integrity and recognition of the Eburon brand. Thank you for your attention to this detail and for ensuring that all front-end elements reflect this guideline.
